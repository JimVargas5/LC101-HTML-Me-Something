				<h2>Vol. 1: Vomit Cake</h2>
				<p>This cake was the first in the Cake Trilogy YouTube series, posted by Filthy Frank on his YouTube channel on July 10th, 2015. 
					As of June 2017, the video has almost 9 million views. 
					The video itself has gained internet notoriety, with many smaller channels posting 'reaction' videos in response to the video's disgusting content, and other larger outlets and personalities acknowledging Frank's filthyness as a contemporary in the star-dominated digital landscape of YouTube. 
					Although most of Filthy Frank's videos become instant viral sensations, <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1awrN9NOEY">"Vomit Cake"</a> was one of his first mega-hits that gave his channel staying power in the anti-PC subculture of the internet, and gave his channel a significant growth in subscribers.

				<p>You will likely find the ingredients that are necessary to bake this cake are quite ordinary, yet what makes this cake so special is the way that the cake is prepared.
					To bake this cake, instead of a mixer, you will need a protege to mix the ingredients for you.
					Your protege will first ingest all of the ingredients, allowing their stomach to mix all of the ingredients.
					This circumvents the need of an electric or manual mixer, and gives the cake a special flavoring unique to the chemistry of your protege's stomach acid.

				<p><b>Materials You Will Need:</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li>1 (or more) protege(s)</li>
					<li>1 Chef DVD</li>
					<li>1 measuring cup</li>
					<li>1 funnel</li>
					<li>1 cake pan</li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>Ingredients:</b></p>
				<ul>
					<li>2 cups of self-raising flower (as it's father left it at a young age)</li>
					<li>approx. 4 eggs (more may be required)</li>
					<li>1 cup of sugar</li>
					<li>water (as necessary)</li>
					<li>1 tea-spoon of vanilla extract</li>
					<li>a few swigs of cooking oil</li>
					<li>milk (as necessary)</li>
					<li>a pinch of salt</li>
					<li>chocolate syrup</li>
					<li>sprinkles/candies to top the cake</li>
					<li>frosting</li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>Directions:</b></p>
				<ol>
					<li>Preheat the oven to 420 degrees Farenheit. Your oven will need to be totally blazed to be able to cook the ingredients properly.</li>
					<li>Assemble your dry ingredients, and using a funnel (or whatever else satisfies the task), have your protege swallow all of the dry ingredients.<br>
						Have your protege drink water to wash down the powder as necessary.</li>
					<li>Next, assemble your wet ingredients, including eggs, and again have your protege swallow all of the ingredients.<br> 
						At this point, you should have your cake pan ready, and poised near your protege's mouth in case they vomit prematurely.</li>
					<li>Once your protege has consumed all of the ingredients, they should be mostly full, and ready to vomit.<br>
						If they are not already vomiting, have your protege run around a little bit, or encourage your protege to vomit by punching them in the stomach, or inserting your finger into their throat.<br>
						Once your protege is ready to vomit, hold your cake pan below your protege's mouth to catch the mixed cake ingredients.</li>
					<li>If the batter needs further mixing, pat the batter with your hand until the batter is properly mixed.</li>
					<li>Let your cake batter mix cook in the oven for about 90 minutes, or until crispy.<br> 
						You should notice several tumors developing on your cake as it cooks.</li>
					<li>Finally, decorate your cake with toppings to taste.<br>
						Set a romantic dinner, and enjoy!</li>
